# One's Lineage
One's Lineage is a text-based, fantasy storyline game.

_I'm a seeker of the unknown, like yourself, ever spinning towards my destiny_

This story game is mainly based on the game **Rogue Lineage**, a perma-death survival game. You get to make choices that affect your interactions through the world of _Gaia_. Be Aligned with the Hero or the Villain, you either wander the land thoughtfully and embrace the light, or wander with betrayal and plunge into darkness.
